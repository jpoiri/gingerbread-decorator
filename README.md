# About

This is an application that allows you to decorate a gingerbread house. I built it for a Holiday activity with my team.

It is in JavaScript, CSS and HTML using [Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/). It supports the following features:

- Circle drawing tool
- Square drawing tool
- Star drawing tool
- Eraser tool
- Stamps
- Eight colors
- Clear All
- Exporting to PNG

It also comes with six gingerbread house templates. Each time the page is loaded a different gingerbread house is loaded.

The application is deployed here:
